This lab felt easier than the other lab we did on this which is probably because I'm more familiar with working in TDM now. 

I was, however, still a bit confused on what I needed to do in the terminal to be able to test what I've done. I solved it by trial and error and I hope that I will soon be more confident in what to do in which terminal windows to get things to work. In the "ds2-tala-speech-frontend.md" file it was good that it says to "you will need to run "okteto up ..." on your DDD, HTTP Service and Rasa model" to be able to do this since I didn't really understand at first what I needed to do to get the tala frontend to work. I also think this could be described in more of a step-by-step manner because now I had to jump between the instructions in the other file on Canvas to sync the right things. It was manageable but just a suggestion for the future.

This time it was easier to know what to add to the different files if I added something to one of the files. I had some trouble understand the second step but once we were given a more thorough instruction it was easier to do that step so that was appreciated.
